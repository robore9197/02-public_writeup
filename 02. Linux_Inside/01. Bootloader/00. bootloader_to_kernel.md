# After power

## 01. Reset vector
```
IP          0xfff0
CS selector 0xf000
CS base     0xffff0000
```
## 02. Processor starts working in real mode. (using only 16-bit register)

### 0201. Memory Segmentation in Real Mode
  - Real mode is compatible with all x86 processor
  - The 8086 processor has a 20-bit address bus
  - But it only has 16-bit register
  - Use segmentation to maximize usage of address space
  - All memory is divided into small, fixed-size segments of 65536 bytes (64 KB)

```
PhysicalAddress = Segment Selector * 16 + Offset
```
Example, if CS:IP is 0x2000:0x0010, then the corresponding physical address will be:
```
>>> hex((0x2000 << 4) + 0x0010)
'0x20010'
```
